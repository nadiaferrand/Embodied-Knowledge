<p>Harvey argues that urbanization processes are deeply tied to capital accumulation, often leading to spatial injustices that disproportionately affect marginalized communities (Harvey, 2008). In Kenya, the privatization and commodification of water services have exacerbated inequalities, with poorer women being less able to afford essential water services</p>

    <p> Sub-Saharan Africa, the region in Africa that lies south of the Sahara desert. The term is often used to label
        the countries of that region and its environs, including island nations and countries that contain part of the
        desert within their borders. This immensely large area covers more than 9,300,000 square miles (24,000,000
        square km), spans parts of all four of the Earth’s hemispheres, and is home to more than 1,246,000,000 people.
        Sub-Saharan Africa can be further divided into subregions: West or western Africa, eastern Africa, middle or
        Central Africa, and Southern Africa.</p>
