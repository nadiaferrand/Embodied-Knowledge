            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The design of urban infrastructure is often seen through the lens of top-down planning and technical expertise. However, this overlooks the invaluable knowledge embedded in daily human experience, particularly among marginalized groups. In Kenya’s informal settlements and rural areas, women are key players in navigating and managing water scarcity. This essay aims to explore the embodied knowledge these women possess—knowledge shaped by lived experience, movement, and bodily engagement with the environment. By integrating this knowledge into urban design, we can create water systems that are not only functional but also resilient and adaptive to local needs.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Framework: Embodied Knowledge in Urban Design</h2>
            <p>The notion of embodied knowledge can be understood through the lens of phenomenology, where space is not merely a backdrop to human activity but something we experience through our bodies. Merleau-Ponty (1962) contends that the body is central to how we perceive and interact with the world, including the design of spaces like urban environments.</p>

            <h2>Women & Water Infrastructure in Kenya: Designing from Lived Experience</h2>
            <p>In Kenya, particularly in areas like Kitui and Nairobi's informal settlements, women develop intimate knowledge of their environment, shaped by the daily realities of water scarcity. Their deep understanding of local water sources, pathways, and social dynamics enables them to manage and optimize water usage. This knowledge, often overlooked in formal planning, can be a valuable asset in urban infrastructure design.</p>
